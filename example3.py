Difference between method and function

Methods are associated with the objects of the class they belong to. Functions are not associated with any object.
We can invoke a function just by its name. Functions operate on the data you pass to them as arguments.

Simply, function and method both look similar as they perform in almost similar way, but the key difference is the concept of ‘Class and its Object‘.

Functions can be called only by its name, as it is defined independently.

But methods can’t be called by its name only, we need to invoke the class by a reference of that class in which it is defined, 
i.e. method is defined within a class and hence they are dependent on that class.

String1 = "This is my first line of code"
print(len(String1)) This is Function
print(String1.upper()) This is Method
